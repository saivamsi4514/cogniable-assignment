

The notebook appears to involve setting up an environment with the following actions:

1. Mounting Google Drive: Using `google.colab` to access the Google Drive for data storage or retrieval.
2. Installing Dependencies: This includes:
   - Installing `yolov8` (YOLOv8 model) and related packages for object detection.
   - Installing `deep-sort-realtime` for object tracking.
   - Installing other related packages like `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `torch`, and `torchvision`.

These steps indicate that the project likely involves analyzing predictions made by the YOLOv8 model combined with object tracking.



The notebook appears to focus on the following tasks:

1. Object Detection Using YOLOv8: The model performs predictions on images and detects objects such as people, suitcases, plants, and other items. The output mentions the number of objects detected (e.g., "9 persons, 1 suitcase") along with inference time metrics.

2. Real-Time Object Tracking: After detecting objects, the system likely uses the `deep-sort-realtime` package for tracking the objects across frames.

3. Performance Metrics: Inference times, preprocessing, and postprocessing times are measured for each image. These statistics are printed after each detection to assess performance.

4. Saving Processed Data: The processed data (e.g., videos or predictions) is archived and downloaded as a zip file.



 Model Prediction and Analysis

 Project Overview
This project uses the YOLOv8 model to detect objects in images and videos, followed by tracking objects across frames using the Deep SORT algorithm. The pipeline is designed to analyze the predictions of the model and assess its performance in real-time object detection and tracking scenarios.

Prerequisites
To reproduce the results, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (recommended) or a local environment with the following packages installed:
  - `yolov8`
  - `deep-sort-realtime`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `torch` and `torchvision`
  - `numpy`

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install yolov8 deep-sort-realtime opencv-python torch torchvision numpy
```

 Instructions

 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

 2. Set Up Google Colab (Optional)
If using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive to store processed files:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

 3. Run Object Detection
Run the YOLOv8 model on your input images or videos:
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model.predict(source='input_video.mp4', show=True)
```
The model will detect objects in each frame and display the results in real-time.

 4. Track Objects
For tracking the detected objects across frames, use the Deep SORT algorithm:
```python
from deep_sort_realtime.deepsort_tracker import DeepSort
tracker = DeepSort()
for frame in video_frames:
    detections = model(frame)
    tracks = tracker.update_tracks(detections)
```
This step will track each object based on its bounding box and class.

 5. Save Processed Data
After detection and tracking, the processed videos can be saved as a zip file:
```python
import shutil
shutil.make_archive('processed_videos', 'zip', video_dir)
```

 6. Download Results
You can download the processed video files directly from Google Colab:
```python
from google.colab import files
files.download('processed_videos.zip')
```

SS Performance Metrics
Each frame's detection process provides metrics such as:
- **Preprocessing Time**: Time taken to prepare the image for inference.
- **Inference Time**: Time taken by the model to detect objects.
- **Postprocessing Time**: Time taken to process the detected objects for tracking.

These metrics are printed during model execution for each frame, helping to analyze the model's efficiency.

 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of object detection and tracking for real-time video processing. The provided setup enables evaluators to reproduce the results and further analyze the model's performance.
